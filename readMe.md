Instructions:

Examine the Test File:

Carefully review the CarTest.java (or your test file name) file.
Pay close attention to the test methods that interact with the Car class.
Identify Attribute Interactions:

Look for test methods that:
Create Car objects.
Use assertEquals() to verify attribute values.
Use methods to modify attribute values.
Infer Getter and Setter Requirements:

If a test method uses assertEquals() to check the value of an attribute (e.g., assertEquals("Toyota", car.getMake());), it strongly suggests that:
A getter method (getMake() in this case) is needed.
If a test method uses a method to change an attribute's value (e.g., car.setMake("Honda");), it indicates that:
A setter method (setMake() in this case) is required.
Repeat this process for all attributes (make, model, year, price).
Verify Completeness:

Ensure that for each attribute of the Car class, you can find corresponding get and set methods being used (or implied) within the test file.
If you find a test that accesses an attribute but there's no corresponding getter or setter in your Car class, you will need to add those methods.
Follow Naming Conventions:

Remember to use the standard getter and setter naming conventions:
Getters: get + attribute name (capitalized).
Setters: set + attribute name (capitalized).
